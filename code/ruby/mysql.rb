NOTES:
Database Object. Singleton by intent, not yet by design.

One option is to use (Rails) ActiveRecord for data management, but it seems that may abstract away more than
desired.

This class is meant to demonstrate basic code for building a "database" class for use with Twitter API clients that retrieve Tweets of interest. It is written in Ruby, but in its present form hopefully will
read like pseudo-code for other languages.
